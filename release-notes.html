                <h1>Oracle Web SDK</h1>
                <h2>June 2020 (Version 20.6.1)</h2>
            </hgroup>
            <p>Welcome to the June 2020 release of the Oracle Web SDK. This update provides fixes for a few critical
                bugs that were
                raised recently. It also addresses a couple of enhancement requests to improve the way conversations are
                managed.</p>
            <section>
                <h3>What's Fixed</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Reflected XSS attacks</strong> - While user messages have never been executable in the
                        chat widget, the skill responses, which may contain rich HTML content that's rendered within the
                        widget, are. Reflected XSS (Cross-site scripting) attacks may become possible when a skill
                        returns a user's message as is (in its current state), because a user could use this message to
                        send malicious code that's executed when the skill returns its response.
                        <br />
                        The user input is now sanitized before it is sent to the skill. This prevents any malicious code
                        in the message that could be executed when the skill, by design, returns the user message as is.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Exceptions in delegates</strong> - The SDK has been updated to handle any errors thrown
                        by the delegate callback implementations. For these errors, the original messages are displayed
                        or sent.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Voice connection in client auth enabled mode</strong> - The previous release (20.5.1)
                        introduced a regression that interfered with the order of the authentication of the voice
                        connection in client auth-enabled mode. This has been resolved and restored to the proper order.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Action button border</strong> - The border of action buttons has been appearing thicker
                        than described by the specifications of the previous release. It has also been appearing in two
                        colors on some browsers. The widget has been updated to the set the border width as 1px and to
                        make it appear in a single color.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Translation of 'Open Map'</strong> - When users shared their location using their
                        device's location services, it appeared as a button entitled 'Open Map' in the conversation.
                        Until now, the label of the button was hard-coded and couldn't be changed. This has been
                        corrected by exposing the <code class="setting">openMap</code> field in the <code
                            class="setting">i18n</code> setting, which allows developers to overwrite the button name
                        and translate it to other languages.<br />
                        For example, <code class="setting">i18n = { en: { <strong>openMap</strong>: 'Show in map' }, fr: { <strong>openMap</strong>: 'Afficher sur la carte' }}
                        </code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Link color contrast in text</strong> - In the SDK's default theme, <code
                            class="setting">WebSDK.THEME.DEFAULT</code>, the link color was very close to the color of
                        the regular text, which made it difficult for some users to distinguish the links and the
                        regular text. The link color has been updated to ensure a contrast ratio that's greater than 3
                        between the links and the regular text color. The result is a clear visual distinction between
                        the links and the rest of the text.
                    </li>

                <h3>What's Improved</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Browser storage management</strong> - The storage service has been redesigned to ensure
                        an efficient use of the browser storage for storing user conversations, and tools have been
                        provided to give more control to the developers. The following improvements have been made to
                        the storage service:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Conversations of anonymous users are now stored in <code>sessionStorage</code> and are
                                automatically deleted when the session ends. The conversation cannot be recovered once
                                the session ends.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong><code class="setting">storageType</code></Strong> - This new setting controls
                                the storage of user conversations with <code>userId</code> passed by the host app. It
                                accepts one of the two values, <code class="setting">localStorage</code>, or <code
                                    class="setting">sessionStorage</code>.<br />
                                By default, the conversations are stored in <code class="setting">localStorage</code>,
                                and are persisted even after the session ends. To store them temporarily, you must pass
                                <code class="setting">storageType: 'sessionStorage'</code> in initial settings.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong><code
                                        class="method">clearConversationHistory(userId, shouldClearWidget)</code></strong>
                                - This new API method has been added to allow clearing the conversation history for a
                                known user from the browser's <code>localStorage</code>. The <code
                                    class="setting">userId</code> must be a string. On passing empty or no <code
                                    class="setting">userId</code>, current user's history is removed. It can help in
                                recovering significant portions of <code>localStorage</code> in the user's
                                browser.<br />
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;If the passed <code class="setting">userId</code> is same as current user's
                                <code class="setting">userId</code>, then you can also pass an optional boolean
                                argument, <code class="setting">shouldClearWidget</code>, to configure whether the
                                current chat widget UI should also be cleared on calling this API. By default, the value
                                is <code>true</code>.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong><code
                                        class="method">clearAllConversationsHistory(shouldClearWidget)</code></strong> -
                                This new API method clears the conversation history for all users from the browser's
                                <code>localStorage</code>. Like <code class="method">clearConversationHistory</code>,
                                this method can also help in recovering significant portions of
                                <code>localStorage</code> from the user's browser.<br />

                                &nbsp;&nbsp;You can also pass an optional boolean
                                argument, <code class="setting">shouldClearWidget</code>, to configure whether the
                                current chat widget UI should also be cleared on calling this API. By default, the value
                                is <code>true</code>.<br />
                                <strong>Warning</strong> - The actions taken by calling this API can not be undone. Once
                                the messages are deleted, they cannot be recovered. Call this method sparingly
                                and only when absolutely needed.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Validation in Delegates</strong> - The SDK now performs a validation of the modified
                        messages returned by the delegate callback handlers. If a returned message does not follow the
                        conversation message model, the SDK reverts to the original message.<br />
                        The SDK handles returned values from delegates as follows:
                        <ul>
                            <li>No value - The SDK does not process the message further for displaying or sending.</li>
                            <li>Falsy value (undefined, null, false) - The SDK does not process the message further for
                                displaying or sending.</li>
                            <li>Invalid value - The SDK reverts to the original message for displaying or sending.</li>
                            <li>Exception/error thrown - The SDK reverts to the original message for displaying or
                                sending.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
